## Life without databases ‚û°Ô∏è issues
In the beginning, there were file-based systems with data stored in files. 

This type of system has problems with:
- __Data redundancy:__ same information kept in different files
- __Data isolation:__ difficult for new apps to find data
- __Concurrency:__ only one process can access a file at any given time

## Life with databases ‚û°Ô∏è üéâ

- __Support for multiple views:__ you can retrieve only the info you want and _only_ that info
- __Multiuser system__: Concurrency control strategies mean more than one person can access the database at a time
- __Data redundancy control__: Ideally, each data item is stored at _one place_ in the database
- __Integrity constraints__: Enforce data integrity by only allowing certain data in certain fields
